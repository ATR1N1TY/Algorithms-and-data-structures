//1. Time complexity AKA bigO
//2. How do we mesure code performance?
//3. Counting operations
//4. Big O notation introduction indepth

//1.

//BigO notation gives us precise numeric and objective way to judge how efficent is the code is

//it helps you write better code and becomes important when number of inputs are huge like FB
//posts, user inputs etc.

//with my understanding, running inneficent code can cost too much because code takes computing
//resources to do it's own things.

//as the code coplmexity increses, consumed computing resources increase too!,
//which means higher electricity bill and low lifespan of servers which your code runs on
//or if you use AWS and other clouding/server services fee would be much higher than it should be!.

// if you aren't building apps, you still must learn this things, because they will ask you
//what's the time complexity of an algorithm which you wrote as they said to do it and solve it
// on the interview.
